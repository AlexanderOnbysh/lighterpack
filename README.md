LighterPack
===========
LighterPack is a website to track the gear you take on adventures. It is still in Beta.

LighterPack is built on a node.js/jQuery/vanillaJS/mongo stack. There are not yet full instructions on how to get LighterPack up and running on your own box.

If you're interested in contributing and have any questions about the coding standards, please let me know. There are many places in the code where shortcuts were taken and  cleanup is needed.

Future non-feature initiatives:
- Migrate to postgres document store from mongo
- Split up LESS files into more logical files (using LESS imports to keep the same # of .css files)
- Split up edit.js somehow + setup a build step to concat files back together
